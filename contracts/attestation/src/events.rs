//! # Structured Event Emissions for Attestations
//!
//! This module defines and emits **normalized**, structured, indexable events
//! for the attestation contract lifecycle.  Every event follows the same
//! schema contract:
//!
//! * **Topic tuple** – `(event_type_symbol, …optional_secondary_key)`.
//! * **Data payload** – a typed `#[contracttype]` struct whose fields are
//!   exhaustive and backwards-compatible.
//! * **Schema version** – all data structs carry an implicit schema version
//!   tracked by `EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`.
//!
//! Events are designed to:
//! - Be indexable by off-chain systems via the first topic element.
//! - Include a secondary topic (usually `business` address) where applicable
//!   for efficient per-business filtering.
//! - Contain all relevant context without exposing sensitive data.
//! - Support correlation across related events via shared `business`/`period`
//!   fields.
//!

//! ## Indexer Compatibility Contract
//!
//! The attestation lifecycle events in this module (`att_sub`, `att_rev`,
//! `att_mig`) are a stable wire contract for off-chain indexers.
//!
//! Compatibility rules:
//! - Topic symbols are stable identifiers and MUST NOT be repurposed.
//! - Field order inside `#[contracttype]` structs is stable.
//! - Backwards-compatible additions are append-only optional fields.
//! - Removing, renaming, reordering, or changing field types is breaking.
//!
//! Breaking-change policy:
//! - Increment `EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` for any breaking event-schema change.
//! - Update indexer-facing documentation in `docs/attestation-events-indexer.md`.
//! - Preserve old historical events; never rewrite or reinterpret ledger history.
//!
//! Duplicate-handling note for indexers:
//! - Failed submissions/migrations do not emit attestation lifecycle events.
//! - Replays are prevented via nonce checks at contract entrypoints.
//!
//! ## Security Notes
//!
//! - Only contract-internal logic calls these functions; no external caller can
//!   manufacture a spurious event.
//! - Events are append-only and cannot be reverted after the ledger closes.
//! - No private keys, raw signatures, or personal data are included in any
//!   event payload.

///
/// - The classification is performed by the contract, not the caller; callers
///   cannot inject a fabricated variant value.
/// - `Other` is the safe default for any unrecognised string, preventing new
///   free-text values from causing panics or unexpected behaviour.
/// - This enum is `#[contracttype]` and XDR-serialised; variant order is
